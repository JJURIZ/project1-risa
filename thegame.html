        <h1>Keeping Your Wits on Risa</h1>
        <p>The vast majority of Risan visitors are here for one thing - a good time! But occasionally a “bad actor” enters the scene and causes trouble for one of our visitors. 

        <p>Commander William T. Riker of the USS Enterprise (yes, that Enterprise!) made one of his many trips to Risa when he encountered Etana Jol, a Ktarian woman.</p> 
            
        <p>Commander Riker was introduced to an augmented reality game by the Ktarian. Instead of pursuing more play from Etana, his attention turned exclusively to the game headset.</p>
            
        <p>Unbeknownst to Riker, the game was actually a mind control device Etana Jol created and Riker replicated on the Enterprise. Soon everyone on the ship was under Etana Jol’s control. A receptive crew member was able to discover and defuse the plot just in time to avert disaster.</p>
            
        <p>We share this story with you in hopes that you will not completely abandon your wits when staying with us.</p>
