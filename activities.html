        <p>     If it makes you happy we have it on Risa! Due to the breadth of options we recommend families book separate accomodations for children under age 16.</p>

        <p>     The main attraction for many of our guests is the rite of Jahahoran. For those so inclined to participate, simply obtain a Horga'hn and display prominently wherever you go. You will be approached in short order and asked if you're ready. It's that easy!</p>

        <p>     Risa has been referred to the "planet that never sleeps". When the tropical sun has set your day has just begun. Nightclubs offer every opportunity for our guests to keep the pleasure ship sailing.</p>

        <p>     If you're looking for something less demanding enjoy one of our many resorts with full accomodations. Access to the crystal clear Risan waters is a matter of walking outside your resort.</p>
