            <h1>Risa - An Overview</h1>
            <p>     Before becoming the go-to destination in the Federation, Risa was a desolate and inhospitable planet. With the help of weather control systems Risa was transformed into paradise. Tourism became (and remains) the number one source of activity for the planet’s inhabitants.</p>
    
            <p>     Risa became synonymous with pleasure. Whether to relax and swim in the crystal clear waters or partake in the jamaharon rite, creatures from across the quadrants flock to Risa.</p>
    
            <h2>Climate</h2>
    
            <p>     Risa maintains a climate described as "the equivalent of a balmy eighty-three degrees Fahrenheit", and that "a warm breeze prevents the heat from becoming oppressive".</p>
    
            <h2>Emphasis on Pleasure</h2>
    
            <p>     Risa is dedicated to pleasure. This is why no weapons are permitted on Risa. Guests on Risa feel secure knowing their safety is a priority.</p> 
    
            <p>     Though the origin of Jamaharon is unknown, it has become well known far and wide. Those seeking to participate in the rite of Jamaharon must obtain a Horga’hn. Once the Horga’hn is displayed Risan’s will approach the willing participant and ask about their intentions.</p>
